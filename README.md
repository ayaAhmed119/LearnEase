# E-Learning System Project

## Project Overview

This project is an E-Learning System designed with JavaScript for two types of users: **Admin** and **Student**. The system includes features such as user authentication, course management, and progress tracking. The goal is to deliver a fully functional, modular system using best practices in coding and team collaboration.

## Team Guidelines

### 1. Workflow and Version Control

- **GitHub Repository**: All code should be committed and pushed to the repository.
- **Branching Strategy**:
  - Use the `main` branch for stable, tested code.
  - Create feature-specific branches for individual tasks (e.g., `feature/authentication`, `feature/admin-crud`).
  - Merge only after review and testing.

### 2. Communication

- Use a team communication platform like **Slack**, **Discord**, or a shared group chat.
- Schedule regular check-ins to discuss progress and roadblocks.

### 3. Task Allocation

- Each team member will be assigned specific tasks or modules. Use a task-tracking tool like **Trello** or **Jira** to monitor progress.

## File and Directory Structure

## Collaboration Instructions

### 1. How to Start

- Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone <repository_url>
  cd e-learning-system
  ```
- Open the project in your preferred code editor (e.g., **VSCode**).

### 2. File Responsibilities

- **HTML**: Structure the pages; ensure the IDs and classes are consistent with JavaScript selectors.
- **CSS**: Style the application; keep separate styles for admin and student interfaces.
- **JavaScript**: Write modular, reusable functions. Use comments to describe each function's purpose.
- **Firebase/Storage**: Set up Firebase or LocalStorage integration and test data operations.

## Task Checklists

### Admin Features

- CRUD operations for courses
- CRUD operations for categories
- View and manage students' progress
- Approve/reject course registrations

### Student Features

- View available courses with filters
- Add courses to a wishlist
- Enroll in courses
- Track progress and view completed courses
- See learning history and certifications

### System-Wide

- Authentication (login/register with validation)
- Logout functionality
- Responsive design

## How to Check and Test Tasks

- **Assign Tasks**: Use the task board to assign specific tasks.
- **Write and Review Code**:
  - Push your feature branch to the repository.
  - Create a pull request and tag another team member for review.
- **Test Functionality**:
  - Ensure proper input validation and error handling.
  - Test on multiple browsers and devices for compatibility.
- **Mark Task as Complete**:
  - Update the task board and checklist after successful testing and merging.

## Best Practices

- **Write Clean Code**:
  - Use meaningful variable and function names.
  - Follow consistent formatting and indentation.
- **Use Comments**:
  - Add comments to explain complex logic or functions.
- **Test Frequently**:
  - Test your code locally before pushing.
- **Ask for Help**:
  - Communicate challenges early to avoid delays.
